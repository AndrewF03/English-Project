		<h3>I decided to make a website using basic HTML, instead of just doing something on paper I figured I'd use a new skill to add some flair</h3>
		<p> To be fair, both my programming and Vocab skills are quite <strong>devoid</strong>, however making a code for my project will hopefully <strong>enhance</strong> the final grade. You may be <strong>skeptical</strong> of my final result at first, as it appears to be <strong>cursory</strong> or <strong>soporific</strong> but a lot of work went into it. Once you see the somewhat <strong>cryptic</strong> code that went into it you'll understand why it took so much effort.
