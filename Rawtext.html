	<h1>Raw Code</h1>
	<h3>To prove that this took a bit of effort despite its looks, I'd like to include the raw text from the code. <br></br> It took a bit of time to not just type it but run and re-run whenever I ran into a problem.<br></br> Plus the time it took to make each file and also make them link together, a skill I never knew before</h3>
