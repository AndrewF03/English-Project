<!-- ^^ To be fair, both my programming and Vocab skills are quite devoid, however making a code for my project will hopefully enhance the final grade. You may be skeptical of my final result at first, as it appears to be cursory or soporific but a lot of work went into it. Once you see the somewhat cryptic code that went into it you'll understand why it took so much effort. There is a copious amount of effor which goes into something so basic. Typing and re-typing and the respite from an error. Much of what is typed is latent because you can only see the result not the work. To some people programming even basic things can seem elusive but once you get started the basics are easy. Creating such a program to run even the simplest of taks is requires one to be quite discerning.</p> -->
